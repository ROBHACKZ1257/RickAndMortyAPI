# Rick and Morty API 

Created a database that displays all the characters with their names and images until someone brings their cursor over to the characters names and clicks on them to see information.

This is a project that I choose to do I thought of something creative in the beginning before the project started I thought of the Hunger Games API and something that I have watched in the past that are currently available in the API but as it turns out not all APIs have them so I went with Rick and Morty.

## Programming Languages: HTML5, CSS, React.js

### Built with: VS Code 

## Instructions:

- If you want to look at the information that each character has on the page you drag the cursor onto to their name

- The name should give a red highlight and should expand a little bit and the cursor will change to a pointer finger, so click on it!

- Here the page shows their information on the character that is setup by the API.

- If you want to go back to the main page to look at other characters in Rick and Morty you would have to hover over the go back button and it will give the same hover animation as you have hover and clicked on the name before.

- Now you are back on the main page if you want to look at other characters that are listed and shown by the API.
