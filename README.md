# Rick and Morty API 

Created a database that displays all the characters with their names and images until someone brings their cursor over to the characters names and clicks on them to see information.

This is a project that I choose to do I thought of something creative in the beginning before the project started I thought of the Hunger Games API and something that I have watched in the past that are currently available in the API but as it turns out not all APIs have them so I went with Rick and Morty.

## Programming Languages: HTML5, CSS, React.js

### Built with: VS Code 

## Instructions:

- If you want to look at the information that each character has on the page you drag the cursor onto to their name
